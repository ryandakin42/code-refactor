# Code Refactor Starter Code

This is a simple website refactored to have more semantic HTML elements and consolidated CSS tags. I changed the header and footer from divs with Header and Footer classes to Header and Footer elements, and I labeled the two sections between them Main and Aside, and the three blocks in each to Sections. I removed the individual classes for each section in the stylesheet and instead had them share one class as they all had a single set of identical attributes applied to them. I added alt attributes to the images and made the title more appropriate instead of leaving it as merely "Website."

This site can simply be opened in a browser. Navigation is standard and sections can be jumped to using the header elements.
